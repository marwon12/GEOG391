## GEOG_391_Project
In this project we took data from twitter related to Covid-19 and TAMU and ran a sentiment analysis over the span of the November 2019 - October 2021 and highlighted how it changed over time. We did this by utilizing python and specific libraries, such as the requests library, to pull the data from the twitter API. When then pulled the parts of the json file for each tweet we pulled, cleaned the text, and then stored it into csv files.
